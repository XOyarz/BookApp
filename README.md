# BookApp
BookApp is a two-fold project: a simple book trading/social network app using Django and the Django Rest Framework, and another app that will populate the previous one with fake users and have them
interact with each other, following certain parameters. All the data resulting from these fake interactions will then be analyzed to study the performance of the social network.
